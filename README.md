List of practical tips and code snippets to avoid unnecessary recomposition in Jetpack Compose. 

This is an active repo, please [contribute](#-contribution) if you discovered useful tips related to recomposition.

The first 5 tips were part of the talk "What does Recomposition mean to your app" by [me](https://cupsofcode.com/about/):

### üî• List of tips:

1. [Break down](/app/src/main/java/com/cupsofcode/recomposition_examples/Tip1.kt) composable functions as much as possible;
2. Use the [key composable](/app/src/main/java/com/cupsofcode/recomposition_examples/Tip2.kt);
3. [Read the state value]((/app/src/main/java/com/cupsofcode/recomposition_examples/Tip3.kt)) at the lowest composable function;
4. Use [Modifier lambdas]((/app/src/main/java/com/cupsofcode/recomposition_examples/Tip4.kt)) for every frequent changing state;

### üìå Contribution

Contributions are more than welcome! 
The more we learn **together** Jetpack Compose, the faster we'll climb that learning curve üí™.

Here are some contribution **rules** to follow:
1. Give the good and bad examples of the same output (see: each Tip file contains `GoodGreetings()` and `BadGreetings()` composable functions);
2. Add the recompose [highlighter](/app/src/main/java/com/cupsofcode/recomposition_examples/RecomposeHighlighter.kt) & [counter](/app/src/main/java/com/cupsofcode/recomposition_examples/RecompositionCounter.kt) to ***every*** composable function via Modifier;
3. Add comments in the beginning of the file to give the overview of the tip, then in subsequent good and bad sections.

Here are some contribution **steps** to follow:
1. Clone this repository;
2. Branch out via `git branch -b someBranchName`;
3. Open Android Studio (or any IDE you feel comfortable working with);
4. Create a separate .kt file;
5. Create a composable function, that starts with `TipX()`, where `X` = the last available number in the tip list + 1;
6. Write your tip;
7. Modify the README doc and include your tip to the [list](#-list-of-tips);
8. Push your tip and open the PR [here](https://github.com/AidaIssayeva/recomposition_examples/pulls).
